# ewd-vista-taskman-monitorThe module will install normally like any Panorama module.If you want to get push capabilities, you will need to do some extra work.Make sure to get the push handler module as a sibling of this module: https://github.com/shabiel/ewd-vista-push-handler.Add this express config to your qewd.js file that starts the server:```var config = <your server configuration>var routes = [{    path: '/ewd-vista-pushdata',      module: 'ewd-vista-push-handler'}]var qewd = require('qewd').master;qewd.start(config, routes);```Four routines need to be edited to call the event end-point: `http://<server ip>:<port>/ewd-vista-pushdata/taskman?task={task}&action={action}`Routines are: %ZTLOAD1.m, %ZTM4.m, %ZTMS2.m, and  %ZTMS3.m. Samples supplied in this repo; I hardcoded the URL inside these. For Cache, I used $ZF(-2). GT.M users should look into OS Pipes with the :INDEPENDENT specifier which should do the same thing as $ZF(-2). Obviously, this needs to be done better, but as I don't plan to maintain taskman, this is just given as is.
